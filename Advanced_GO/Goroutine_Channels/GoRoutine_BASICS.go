													GO ROUTINE
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	#	In Go, a goroutine is a lightweight, concurrent thread of execution. It's a way to run functions concurrently, 
		independently of the main program flow. Goroutines enable you to write concurrent programs with ease 
		and efficiency.

	#	using "go" keyword we can create goroutine

	#   Goroutines communicate with each other using channels. 
		Channels provide a safe way for goroutines to share data and synchronize their execution.
